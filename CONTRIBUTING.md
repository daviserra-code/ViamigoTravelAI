   git clone https://github.com/daviserra-code/ViamigoTravelAI.git
   cd ViamigoTravelAI
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style of the project

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Run the application and test manually
   - Check for console errors
   - Test with different inputs and edge cases

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused on a single task

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ syntax where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)

### General
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Update documentation when adding features
- Remove debug code before committing

1. **Plan your implementation**:
   - Consider the impact on existing code
   - Think about edge cases
   - Document your approach

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Update relevant .md files
   - Add code comments
   - Update SETUP.md if setup changes

3. **Add tests** (if applicable):
   - Create test files following existing patterns
   - Test both success and failure cases

4. **Consider performance**:
   - Avoid blocking operations
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Minimize API calls

## Bug Reports
