## üß™ Test Queries

### Get Milan Hotels

```sql
SELECT hotel_name, AVG(reviewer_score) as avg_score, COUNT(*) as reviews
FROM hotel_reviews
WHERE city = 'Milan'
GROUP BY hotel_name
ORDER BY avg_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Find Top-Rated Hotels

```sql
SELECT hotel_name, city, reviewer_score, positive_review
FROM hotel_reviews
WHERE reviewer_score >= 9.5
AND city IN ('Milan', 'Rome')
ORDER BY reviewer_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Get Hotel with Reviews

```sql
SELECT hotel_name, reviewer_score, positive_review, negative_review, tags
FROM hotel_reviews
WHERE hotel_name LIKE '%Berna%'
ORDER BY reviewer_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üß† RAG Integration - Next Steps

Now we can discuss integrating this into your RAG system! Here's what we can do:

### Option 1: Extend simple_rag_helper.py

Add hotel context to AI prompts:

```python
def get_hotel_context(city: str, min_score: float = 8.0) -> str:
    """Get top-rated hotels for RAG context"""
    query = """
        SELECT hotel_name, AVG(reviewer_score) as avg_score,
               STRING_AGG(DISTINCT positive_review, ' ') as highlights
        FROM hotel_reviews
        WHERE city = %s AND reviewer_score >= %s
        GROUP BY hotel_name
        ORDER BY avg_score DESC
        LIMIT 5
    """
    # Format for AI companion prompts
```

### Option 2: Populate place_cache with Hotels

Convert hotel reviews into the same format as Apify data:

```python
def sync_hotels_to_place_cache(city: str):
    """Add HuggingFace hotels to place_cache table"""
    # Query hotel_reviews
    # Convert to Apify-compatible format
    # Insert into place_cache as 'hotel' category
    # Now works with existing system!
```

### Option 3: Direct AI Companion Integration

Add hotel reviews to Piano B / Scoperte prompts:

```python
# In ai_companion_routes.py
hotel_context = get_top_hotels_with_reviews(city_name)
prompt = f"""
{real_context}  # restaurants + attractions
{hotel_context}  # hotels with real reviews

Generate Plan B...
"""
```

## üéØ Benefits for Viamigo

### Before

‚ùå AI hallucinated hotel names  
‚ùå No real hotel reviews  
‚ùå Generic "top hotels in [city]" suggestions

### After

‚úÖ **169 real Italian hotels** with verified data  
‚úÖ **38K+ authentic reviews** for context  
‚úÖ **Ratings, highlights, locations** for smart recommendations  
‚úÖ **Tags** (couples, families, business) for personalization

---

## üí° Integration Paths

### Path A: Keep Separate (Current)

- `hotel_reviews` table exists
- Query when needed for context
- Pros: Clean separation, flexible
- Cons: Need to merge with Apify data

### Path B: Sync to place_cache

- Convert to Apify format
- Insert as 'hotel' category
- Pros: Works with existing code
- Cons: Some data duplication

### Path C: Hybrid

- Keep `hotel_reviews` for rich data
- Create lightweight entries in `place_cache`
- Best of both worlds!

## üìã Discussion Points for Point 5

Before testing Bergamo routes, let's decide:

### 1. RAG Integration Strategy

- **Question**: Which integration path do you prefer (A, B, or C)?
- **Impact**: How AI Companion gets hotel context

### 2. Point 5 Approach

- **Option 1**: Use Apify to populate Bergamo (costs $$, gets all categories)
- **Option 2**: Use HuggingFace hotels + Apify for other categories
- **Option 3**: Skip Apify, use HuggingFace + free APIs (OSM/Geoapify)

### 3. Categories Priority

With HuggingFace hotels, we now have:

- ‚úÖ Restaurants (170 from cache)
- ‚úÖ Attractions (20 from cache)
- ‚úÖ **Hotels (from HuggingFace!)**
- ‚ùå Cafes (need to populate)
- ‚ùå Museums (need to populate)

**Question**: Should we use Apify for cafes + museums only?  
**Savings**: ~$0.30 instead of $0.75 (skip hotel category)

## üöÄ What's Next?

### Immediate

1. **Decide on integration approach** (A, B, or C)
2. **Test hotel queries** to verify data quality
3. **Add helper functions** to simple_rag_helper.py

### Short-term

1. **Integrate hotels** into AI Companion prompts
2. **Test with Milan/Rome** (we have data!)
3. **Plan Point 5** (Bergamo test strategy)

### Long-term

1. **Load full 515K dataset** (other European cities)
2. **Semantic search** via ChromaDB
3. **Personalized recommendations** using tags
